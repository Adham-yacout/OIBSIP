# Iris Dataset Analysis
Welcome to my Iris dataset analysis repository! In this Jupyter Notebook, I explore the famous Iris dataset using various machine learning algorithms - Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Additionally, I've included visualizations to provide insights into the dataset.

# Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the realm of machine learning, featuring measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

# Notebook
In this notebook you will find :

## Decision Tree Model:
Application of a Decision Tree classifier to the Iris dataset.
### Model Training:
Utilizes the scikit-learn DecisionTreeClassifier.
Fits the model to the training data.
###Evaluation:
Assesses the model's performance on a test dataset.
Calculates key metrics such as accuracy.
### Visualizations:
Presents confusion matrix plots for a deeper understanding of classification results.
## Logistic Regression Model:

### Model Training:
Uses scikit-learn's LogisticRegression module.
Trains the model with the Iris dataset.
### Evaluation:
Assesses the accuracy and other relevant metrics.
### Visualizations:
Utilizes various plotting techniques to visualize the logistic regression results.

## Random Forest Model:

### Model Training:
Trains the model with the Iris dataset.
### Evaluation:
Assesses the model's accuracy on a test dataset.
Calculates key metrics to evaluate performance.

### Visualizations:
Showcases decision boundaries of the Random Forest classifier for enhanced understanding.
